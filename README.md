Nanophysics and Nanotechnology

This repository provides the equivalnet of hands-on experience(including one hour of Computer Lab per week) for graduate students in sciences (physics, chemistry, applied mathematics) and engineering (electrical, chemical, materials) to analyze electronic structure and transport properties of basic classes of nanostructures explored at the current research frontiers.

Much of the work here requires the kwant package (https://kwant-project.org/install) which can be simply installed in google colab or any other python based software.
In colab, kwant can be installed by running: pip install kwant
